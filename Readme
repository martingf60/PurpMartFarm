This is an effort to create some trend graphs at county level or perhaps lower to track the infection.  Purple Martin Farm is located on Vashon Island Washington, in King County (nestled in Puget Sound between Seattle and Tacoma).  So the focus will be on those three areas.  Seattle/King County, Tacoma/Pierce County, and Vashon Island (which is part of King County).
